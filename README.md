# GodotCatGame
A small and simple game I built to learn the basics of the Godot game engine.

You can get a Windows executable from the release page.

You can also visit the itch.io page to play it in browser: https://suneatergames.itch.io/cat-game-prototype

Note - This doesn't work on Firefox for some machines. I recommend trying on Chrome or Edge.

If for some reason you want to build it off source, please use Godot 4.2. Using a newer version causes a few minor bugs. Nothing game breaking, but visually off.

Feel free to leave me a comment on the itch page if you have any questions!
